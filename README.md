# Intro Stats: Foundations of Inference

## Course description

One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference:  the act of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data.  Using reverse logic, we make an assumption about the population that we want to disprove using our data.  For example, to show that one treatment is better than another we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to be disproved by the data (hooray, our treatment is better!).  Additionally, we discuss the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis - called the p-value.  And last, we will discuss confidence intervals which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g., how much better the one treatement is from the other).  Not only are ideas of inference fascinating and powerful in their own right, they are also ubiquitous in all of science.  Understanding p-values and confidence intervals will allow you to rigorously interpret the way much of science is communicated.

## Learning objectives

* State the logic of inferential analysis.
* Write out the steps of a randomization algorithm.
* Run a randomization test in R.
* Write-up an entire hypothesis test in R from stating hypotheses through concluding about the population / process.
* Connect the idea of a confidence interval to knowledge of the population values.
* Predict how a confidence interval will be impacted by changing values of the data, the sample size, and the degree of confidence desired.

## Prerequisites

* Introduction to R
* Intro Stats: Introduction to Data
* Intro Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis
* Intro Stats: Correlation and Regression
