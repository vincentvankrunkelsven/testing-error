# Intro Stats: Foundations of Inference

## Course description

One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference: the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data.  With reverse logic, we make an assumption about the population that we want to disprove using our data.  For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data (hooray, our treatment is better!).  Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis.  And last, we dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).  Not only are ideas of inference fascinating and powerful in their own right, they are also used in almost all of science.  Understanding p-values and confidence intervals will allow you to rigorously interpret the way much of science is communicated.

## Learning objectives

* State the logic of inferential analysis.
* Write out the steps of a randomization algorithm.
* Run a randomization test in R.
* Write-up an entire hypothesis test in R from stating hypotheses through forming conclusions about the population or process.
* Calculate statistical power based on given values for effect and sample sizes.
* Connect the idea of a confidence interval to knowledge of the population values.
* Predict how a confidence interval will be impacted by changing values of the data, the sample size, and the degree of confidence desired.

## Prerequisites

* Introduction to R
* Introduction to Data
