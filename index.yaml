      content : Summarize what we can say about gender discrimination.  Note that we are given a randomized study, so it makes sense to infer causal conclusions.  It is not, however, a random sample from the population, so we should be wary of concluding back to a larger population.  Additionally, the p-value is 0.02 which is thought of to be moderately significant and not extremely significant.

  chapter_description: We will continue with a new example and the same structure of creating a randomization test.  Here, however, the focus will be on different errors (type I and type II), how they are made, when one is worse than another, and how things like sample size and effect size affect the error rates.

  exercises :
  -   type    : VideoExercise
      title   : Type I Errors
      content : Revisit all the ideas of simulation under the null setting.  Notice that if the null is true two things happen (1) we can only commit type I errors, and (2) because we've controlled the type I error rate, we don't make a huge number of errors

      title   : Simulating type I error
      content : start with two populations (null true) and select samples.  calculate type I error rate.

      title   : False positives 
      content : Discussion of how the false discovery rate can explode with exploratory science.  Examples of reproducibility problems.
  
  -   type    : MultipleChoiceExercise
