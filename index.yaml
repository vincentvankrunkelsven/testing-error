      content : calculate a two-sided p-value given a randomization distribution(s) (made up, different from gender data)
  
  -   type    : VideoExercise
      title   : Summary of gender discrimination
      content : Summarize what we can say about gender discrimination.  Note that we are given a randomized study, so it makes sense to infer causal conclusions.  It is not, however, a random sample from the population, so we should be wary of concluding back to a larger population.  Additionally, the p-value is 0.02 which is thought of to be moderately significant and not extremely significant.

- chapter_title : Hypothesis testing Errors: opportunity cost
  chapter_description: We will continue with a new example and the same structure of creating a randomization test.  Here, however, the focus will be on different errors (type I and type II), how they are made, when one is worse than another, and how things like sample size and effect size affect the error rates.
