## Introduction and exploring raw data

* Assume data already read into R (see Importing Data course)
* Propose a three step data cleaning process
  * Exploring raw data
  * Tidying data
  * Preparing data for analysis
* Exploring raw data
  * View the structure of your data
  * Summarize your data
  * Look at your data
  * Visualize your data (with base R)

## Tidying data

* Principles of tidy data
* Common symptoms of messy data
* Introduction to tidyr
* Tidying messy data with tidyr

## Preparing data for analysis

* Type conversion
* String manipulation (stringr)
* Missing and special values
* Outliers and obvious errors

## Putting it all together

* Large messy dataset
* Use methods from entire course
* Now have the tools necessary to take on the messiest of datasets
* Recommend practicing on more real datasets
